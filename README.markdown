Socal
=====
Socal - is "Socialendar" just lose "i". There has been an attempt to integrate almost every thing on social networks. We will integrate your calendar and daily agenda on your social network - twitter, facebook, et al.
If you want to share the location of your calendar event on Gowalla, Foursquare, etc. - we will let you do that. Just be careful that your ex is not listening too :)
This is a weekend hack project and has many bugs. If you want to try this app in its alpha state, please head on to :

I will be pushing a lot of features and fixes daily and would appreciate your bug reports, ideas and critiques.
